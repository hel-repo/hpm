SYNOPSIS
  hpm COMMAND

DESCRIPTION
  Command-line package manager for OpenOS (OpenComputers). Allows to easily download and install programs from the Hel Repository. Alternative app sources are (planned to be) supported: Pastebin, Gist, GitHub, direct links.
  Also you can define your own way of package distribution, via custom hpm modules.

  Available commands:
  install <package> [...]   Download package[s] and their dependencies from the Hel Repository, and install it to the system.
  remove <package> [...]    Remove package[s] and their dependants from the system.

METHOD-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
